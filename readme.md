# API Odyssey: Navigating Backend and Deployment Frontiers

This project is a Django Rest API for a Slot Booking System aimed at enhancing operational efficiency. It utilizes JWT Token authentication to ensure secure access to the system. PostgreSQL is employed as the robust backend database.

## Features

- **JWT Token authentication** for secure access
- **PostgreSQL** backend for efficient data management, particularly for image data
- Containerized application with **Docker** for seamless deployment
- Custom DjangoREST, PostgreSQL, and Nginx images integrated for deployment
- **NGINX** and **Gunicorn** used for effective request balancing
- **Caching** and **Reverse Proxy** concept employed for automated deployment process

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sarangk02/Booking-System.git
   ```

2. Start your docker daemon and run the command:
    ```shell

    ```

3. Make django database migrations and create superuser named admin and enter your choice of password
    ```shell
    docker compose exec web ./setup.sh
    ```

4. Visit the localhost and you can see your website ready to access on [localhost](http://localhost:80) port 80 i.e. default port
